# Dice Combination Generator
Generates all combinations of dice given the number of sides and number of dice using recursion.

#### Edit the const values of dice_sides and num_dice to your desired values:
```
const dice_sides = 6;
const num_dice = 5;
```

#### Formula to check calculations:
```
N = Number of Dice; S = Number of Sides;

(N + S - 1)! / (N!(S - 1)!)
```

In this example, the number is 252 combinations.
